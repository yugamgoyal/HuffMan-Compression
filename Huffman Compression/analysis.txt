First thing I wanted to see is if a compressed file can be further compressed and if so 
how bits on avg can we save

Lets run this with waterloo first we get the following data:

As it can be seen all of the compression percent for all these types of files is below 2 percent 
meaning that compressing an already compressed file leads to not much saved data this means 
that compression for Standard Count does not do much. 

Next I was curious about jpg and if we can compress a photo and save a lot of bits here is the data:

as we can seen the percent compression is very very low this tells us that a 
jpg is already very compressed and therefore further compression is not needed 
using the huffman algorithm

Now I am curious if this algorithm helps a pdf compress further. To get a good representation 
I compressed a very large pdf of Bottoms Dream by ARNO SCHMIDT. Here are the results: 

compressing to: /u/goyalyug/eclipse-workspace/A10/pdfStuff/Bottom’s Dream (Schmidt, Arno Woods, John E.) (z-lib.org).pdf.hf
Bottom’s Dream (Schmidt, Arno Woods, John E.) (z-lib.org).pdf from 124383985 to 123850014 in 201.722
--------
total bytes read: 124383985
total compressed bytes 123850014
total percent compression 0.429
compression time: 201.722

As it can be seen the data for pdf is already very compressed so no further compression is needed 

I was also wondering if a emoji file can be compressed and here are the results: 

compressing to: /Users/yugamgoyal/eclipse-workspace/CS314A10PT2/emoji/emji.txt.hf
emji.txt from	 5207 to	 3908 in	 0.052
--------
total bytes read: 5207
total compressed bytes 3908
total percent compression 24.947
compression time: 0.052

An TXT with just emoji is interesting because you can compress it and save data which means
we could compress our texts and save data 

NOW I HAVE REPEATED EVERYTHING ABOVE WITH STORE TREE HERE ARE THE RESULTS:

As it can be seen the compression data is relatively the same. 
Even for the compressing a compressed file we can see that it doesnt further compress it much. 

The last thing I am curious about is if we were to compress something with store count first 
and then store tree to compress the already compressed file with store count.

This is very interesting because this means that mixing the header styles does not lead to a better 
result

Something I noticed is that when there is a even distribution for the frequency then there is 
no need for the compression as it still takes eight bits to save each of them. Whenever there is a 
skewed distribution then you should compress and it should save bits since there will be things that 
have a high frequency so it will be higher up on the HuffMan tree and use less bits to save
